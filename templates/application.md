# Microgrant programs - application template

If you're thinking about starting a microgrant program, this is the application form I used for running [Helium Grants](https://www.heliumgrant.org/). I highly recommend using a Google Form (or similar) to accept applications. You don't have to worry about the form breaking, applicants can email a copy to themselves, you can enforce text validation and character limits, and everything exports nicely to a spreadsheet for reviewing.

This template is licensed under [Creative Commons Zero](LICENSE.md), so really, feel free to shamelessly copy and use it for your own purposes, without any attribution back to me.

### Intro text

Hi! Thanks for your interest in applying for a Helium Grant. A few things to note:

* Please read the FAQ *[LINK_TO_FAQ]* before applying
* Applications close on *[APPLICATION_DEADLINE_DATE_AND_TIME_AND_TIMEZONE!]*
* If the form successfully submitted, your application has been received. Due to volume, I cannot comment on the status of specific applications. Expect a followup email by *[DATE]*, letting you know whether you received a grant or not.
* Please only submit a proposal that you can achieve with an additional *[GRANT_CHECK_SIZE]*. If your proposal requires more money, this isn't the right grant for you.
* Out of fairness to others, please only submit *one* application. If you have multiple ideas, choose only one to submit. If you submit multiple applications, you will be disqualified.
* Your application may be shared with additional grant sponsors. Otherwise, I promise it won't be shared with anyone.
* If you're successfully funded, your name and project will be published.

Thanks for taking part in this grand experiment!
