# A list of microgrant programs for your good ideas.

I started a microgrant program called [Helium Grants](https://heliumgrant.org), providing small no-strings-attached grants to people on the internet. It's a lot of fun!

I wish I could fund more projects, but I'm not that rich. So, here are some other microgrant programs I learned about that also fund good ideas:

## 5x5 Night
